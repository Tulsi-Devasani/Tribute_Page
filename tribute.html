<h2>A brief summary of Kalpana Chawla</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Born in Karnal, India, on March 17, 1962, to parents Banarasi Lal Chawla and Sanjyothi Chawla, Kalpana Chawla
 was the youngest of four children. Until she started school, Chawla hadn't been formally named.
 Her parents called her Montu, but Chawla picked her own name from a selection when she entered education. 
 The name Kalpana means "idea" or "imagination." Her full name is pronounced CULL-pah-na CHAU-la, though she
 often went by the nickname K.C. As a child, Chawla developed an interest in flying after first seeing a plane at
 around the age of three. She spent days with her father visiting her local flying club with her father and 
 showed an interest in aviation while at school. </p>

<h3>Eduction</h3>
<p>During her earlier education in India, Chawla attended Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal. 
Chawla obtained a degree in aeronautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College. When selecting the course,
 professors tried to dissuade her, as there were limited opportunities for girls in India following this career
 path. However, Chawla was adamant that this was the subject for her.After completing her engineering degree in
 India, Chawla immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and became a naturalized citizen to continue her 
 studies. She obtained her masters degree from the University of Texas and earned a doctorate in aerospace 
 engineering from the University of Colorado in 1988.Chawla began working at NASA's Ames Research Center the 
 same year, working on powered-lift computational fluid dynamics. In particular, her work(opens in new tab)
 focused on understanding how air flows around an aircraft during flight and incorporating computers
 into the work.</p>

<h3>Becoming an Astronaut</h3>
<p>
In 1994, Chawla was selected as an astronaut candidate. After a year of training, she became a crew representative for the Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branches, where she worked with Robotic Situational Awareness Displays and tested software for the space shuttles.
Chawla felt passionately about providing science education opportunities for young girls in India, and during her time as an astronaut, NASA invited Chawla's secondary school to take part in their Summer Space Experience Program. Each year from 1998, the school sent two girls to the Foundation for International Space Education's United Space School in Houston and Chawla would invite them into her home for an Indian dinner.
Chawla's first flight came in November 1997, aboard the space shuttle Columbia on flight STS-87(opens in new tab). The shuttle made 252 orbits of the Earth in just over two weeks. Chawla was a mission specialist and prime robotic arm operator for the flight; the other astronauts on board were Kevin Kregel, Steven Linsey, Winston Scott, Takao Doi and Leonid Kadenyuk.
The shuttle carried a number of experiments, including projects studying plant reproduction in microgravity and how materials behave in space.
In addition, Chawla used the robotic arm to deploy a satellite called SPARTAN 201, which was meant to study the outer layer of the sun, called the corona. However, the satellite malfunctioned and could not control its position upon deployment, according to NASA(opens in new tab). Two other astronauts from the mission had to perform a spacewalk to recapture the satellite and the instrument never conducted any research.
After her first flight, Chawla said, "When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land, but from the solar system."
